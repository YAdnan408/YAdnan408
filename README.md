# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Yamin Adnan

I am an undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering student at BRAC University, Bangladesh, with a strong passion for artificial intelligenceâ€”including machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and data science as well as web development. I excel at the intersection of software and hardware, where I engineer data-driven solutions that create tangible impact in the real world. Currently, Iâ€™m advancing my proficiency in the MERN stack while rigorously expanding my expertise in data science tools, frameworks, and methodologies. I actively seek out cutting-edge technologies and high-stakes challenges that push the boundaries of innovation and deliver measurable value.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web development project using the MERN framework as well as a deep learning project where I'll be training neural network models.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AI-driven projects, web developmentand designing interactive user interfaces
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with FinTech
